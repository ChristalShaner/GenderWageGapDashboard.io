# GenderWageGapDashboard.io

This is the first Tableau dashboard I have ever created, and I am proud that it represents and analyzes a cause that is of great significance to myself and society. 
I made this dashboard with Tableau Desktop, and utilized a sample data set created by Willian Oliveira Gibin on Kaggle. He gathered information from 64 countries and documented the percentage wage gap over 36 years from available data. It is a relatively small set of information, and the resulting dashboard is small as well. It was a wild ride, learning Tableau through videos and experimentation, and a test of confidence for graphic design and accessibility.

The image below is a glance at the final product. You may also check it out in its interactive state on GitHub Pages! If you have any questions about the data or its presentation, don't hesitate to ask!
