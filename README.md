# GenderWageGapDashboard.io

This is the first Tableau dashboard I have ever created, and I am proud that it represents and analyzes a cause that is of great significance to myself and society. 
I made this dashboard with Tableau Desktop, and utilized a sample data set created by Willian Oliveira Gibin on Kaggle. He gathered information from 64 countries and documented the percentage wage gap over 36 years from available data. It is a relatively small set of information, and the resulting dashboard is small as well. It was a wild ride, learning Tableau through videos and experimentation, and a test of confidence for graphic design and accessibility.

Feel free to check it out through GitHub pages, linked below, along with the original data set link.
